# Results of accuracy tests

This folder contains the results of the accuracy tests performed by the notebooks and a code speed comparison between homogeneous and variable density.

By saving the results in these files, there's no need to rerun the tests in order to plot them.

* `Dlinear`, `D-vs-height`, `Dlinear-vs-slope`: These folders contain the results of the    [03-linear-density-test.ipynb](https://github.com/pinga-lab/tesseroid-variable-density/blob/master/code/03-linear-density-test.ipynb) notebook.

* `Dexp`, `Dexp-shifted`, `Dexp-vs-power`: These folders contain the results of the [04-exponential-density-test.ipynb](https://github.com/pinga-lab/tesseroid-variable-density/blob/master/code/04-exponential-density-test.ipynb) notebook.

* `Ddiscontinuous`: This folder contains the results of the [05-discontinuous-density-test.ipynb](https://github.com/pinga-lab/tesseroid-variable-density/blob/master/code/05-discontinuous-density-test.ipynb) notebook.

* `speed-comparison`: This folder contains the results of the comparison between the computation times for an homogeneous and a variable density tesseroid.
