# Results of accuracy tests

This folder contains the results of the accuracy tests performed by the notebooks.

By saving the results in these files, there's no need to rerun the tests in order to plot them.

* `Dlinear`, `D-vs-height`: These folders contain the results of the    [03-linear-density-test.ipynb](https://github.com/pinga-lab/tesseroid-variable-density/blob/master/code/03-linear-density-test.ipynb) notebook.

* `Dexp`, `Dexp-shifted`, `Dexp-vs-power`: These folders contain the results of the [04-exponential-density-test.ipynb](https://github.com/pinga-lab/tesseroid-variable-density/blob/master/code/04-exponential-density-test.ipynb) notebook.

* `Ddiscontinuous`: This folder contains the results of the [05-discontinuous-density-test.ipynb](https://github.com/pinga-lab/tesseroid-variable-density/blob/master/code/05-discontinuous-density-test.ipynb) notebook.
