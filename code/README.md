# Source code for producing the results and figures

Describe your code briefly here.

List the notebooks here with links to each on nbviewer:

* [01-simple-example.ipynb](https://github.com/pinga-lab/tesseroid-variable-density/blob/master/code/01-simple-example.ipynb):
  It contains two example codes that performs the gravity fields calculation using either a single tesseroid with variable density in depth or a mesh of tesseroid that mixes variable with constant densities.

* [02-spherical-shell-analytical-solutions.ipynb](https://github.com/pinga-lab/tesseroid-variable-density/blob/master/code/02-spherical-shell-analytical-solutions.ipynb):
  In this notebook we obtain the analytical solution for the gravity potential generated by a spherical shell with variable density in depth. We make use of SageMath to calculate the potential field for linear and exponential densities.

* [03-linear-density-test.ipynb](https://github.com/pinga-lab/tesseroid-variable-density/blob/master/code/03-linear-density-test.ipynb):
  In order to guarantee the accuracy of the numerical calculation of the new method, we compare the previously calculated gravity fields generated by a spherical shell with the corresponding tesseroid model, both with the same density function. In this notebook we use that comparison in order to obtain a minimum distance-size ratio value in order to guarantee a accuracy of 10<sup>-1</sup>% for a linear density function.

* [04-exponential-density-test.ipynb](https://github.com/pinga-lab/tesseroid-variable-density/blob/master/code/04-exponential-density-test.ipynb):
  In order to guarantee the accuracy of the numerical calculation of the new method, we compare the previously calculated gravity fields generated by a spherical shell with the corresponding tesseroid model, both with the same density function. In this notebook we use that comparison in order to obtain a minimum distance-size ratio value in order to guarantee a accuracy of 10<sup>-1</sup>% for an exponential density function.

* [05-discontinuous-density-test.ipynb](https://github.com/pinga-lab/tesseroid-variable-density/blob/master/code/05-discontinuous-density-test.ipynb):
  In order to guarantee the accuracy of the numerical calculation of the new method, we compare the previously calculated gravity fields generated by a spherical shell with the corresponding tesseroid model, both with the same density function. In this notebook we use that comparison in order to obtain a minimum distance-size ratio value in order to guarantee a accuracy of 10<sup>-1</sup>% for a discontinuous density function.

* [06-plot-figures.ipynb.ipynb](https://github.com/pinga-lab/tesseroid-variable-density/blob/master/code/06-plot-figures.ipynb.ipynb):
  On this notebook we produce the figures and save them in SVG files ready for publication.
