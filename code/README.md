# Source code for producing the results and figures

Describe your code briefly here.

List the notebooks here with links to each on nbviewer:

* [01_example.ipynb](https://github.com/pinga-lab/tesseroid-variable-density/blob/readme/code/01_example.ipynb):
  It contains two example codes that performs the gravity fields calculation using either a single tesseroid with variable density in depth or a mesh of tesseroid that mixes variable with constant densities.

* [02_spherical_shell_variable_density.ipynb](https://github.com/pinga-lab/tesseroid-variable-density/blob/readme/code/02_spherical_shell_variable_density.ipynb):
  In this notebook we obtain the analytical solution for the gravity potential generated by a spherical shell with variable density in depth. We make use of SageMath to calculate the potential field for linear and exponential densities.

* [03_D-linear-ratio-determination.ipynb](https://github.com/pinga-lab/tesseroid-variable-density/blob/readme/code/03_D-linear-ratio-determination.ipynb):
  In order to guarantee the precission of the numerical calculation of the new method, we compare the previously calculated gravity fields generated by a spherical shell with the corresponding tesseroid model, both with the same density function. In this notebook we use that comparision in order to obtain a minimum distance-size ratio value in order to guarantee a precission of 10$^{-1}\%$ for a linear density function.

* [04_D-exp-ratio-determination.ipynb](https://github.com/pinga-lab/tesseroid-variable-density/blob/readme/code/04_D-exp-ratio-determination.ipynb):
  In order to guarantee the precission of the numerical calculation of the new method, we compare the previously calculated gravity fields generated by a spherical shell with the corresponding tesseroid model, both with the same density function. In this notebook we use that comparision in order to obtain a minimum distance-size ratio value in order to guarantee a precission of 10$^{-1}\%$ for a exponential density function.
