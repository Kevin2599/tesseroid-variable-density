\section{Introduction}

Lithosphere density variation with depth has been studied for almost a century. 
\citet{Athy1930} obtained a decreasing exponential relation between both quantities by studying shale samples.
In the following years, other density functions have been proposed for different rock types \citep[e.g.,][]{Maxant1980, Rao1986, Rao1993, Rao1994}.
Furthermore, the density variation with depth has been taken into account in forward and inversion gravity models, mostly applied to grabens and basins \citep{Cordell1973, Rao1986, Cowie1990, Rao1993, Rao1994, Zhang2001, Welford2010}.

These forward gravity models have been developed for two or three dimensional bodies in cartesian coordinates that properly fit local scales applications.
Nevertheless, the latest satellite missions have provided us gravity measurements with global coverage, which allows geologists and geophysics to perform modelling and interpretation in regional scales.
This raises the importance of building forward models that reassemble the gravity anomalies for such scales.

The main issue that should be overcome is taking into account the curvature of the Earth, thus the forward model must be defined in spherical coordinates.
A common way to achieve this is to discretize the Earth in spherical prisms known as tesseroids, which are defined by pairs of latitude, longitude and radius boundaries (see Figure \ref{fig:tesseroid-uieda}).
Given an arbitrary tesseroid, calculating the gravity fields on any external point involves the resolution of volume integrals that are generally approximated by numerical computations.
The literature offers two approaches: one involves Taylor series expansion \citep{Heck2007, Grombein2013} while the other makes use of Gauss-Legendre Quadrature (GLQ) \citep{Asgharzadeh2007, Uieda2016, Uieda2017}.
The later consists in approximating the integral by a weighted sum of the effect of point masses located at scaled nodes of the Legendre polynomials.

\end{figure}

\citet{Uieda2016} developed a forward gravity model based on tesseroids with homogeneous densities using the GLQ approximation method.
It has been originally implemented in command line programs written in C programming language.
Although, it has been ultimately ported to Python and included in the open-source library Fatiando a Terra \citep{Uieda2013} for geophysical modelling and inversion.

In order to develop a forward model that computes the gravity field generated by any tesseroid with arbitrary variable density, the Taylor series expansion is not well suited, because it would need to derive the series expansion terms for each density function.
On the other hand, the GLQ allows us to calculate them for any density function without any other information but the function itself.

It's well known that the GLQ method becomes less accurate when the computation point is closer to the tesseroid \citep{Ku1977} or for smaller GLQ order. 
Although the model developed by \citet{Uieda2016} uses a second order GLQ, it ensures the accuracy implementing a modified version of the adaptive discretization of \citet{Li2011}.
It consist in splitting the tesseroid into smaller ones when a certain distance-size ratio is greater than a predefined value ($D$) that controls the accuracy of the computation. 
\citet{Uieda2016} have also objectively obtained standard values of $D$ for gravity potential, gradients and tensor components comparing the fields generated by a spherical shell, which constitutes a special case of the volume integrals that has analytical solution \citep{LaFehr1991, Mikuska2006, Grombein2013}\todo{citar mas??}.
The modifications made by \citet{Uieda2016} to the original adaptive discretization method \citep{Li2011} consist in:
(1) a faster calculation of the distance from the computation point to the tesseroid and 
(2) the application of a stack based algorithm that speeds up the computation and gives more control over the recursion step.

We have enhanced the later implementation with a new forward gravity model that allows us to compute the gravity fields generated by any tesseroid with an arbitrary density function on any external point.
It's written in Python and Cython languages, obtaining an easy to use library that runs precompiled code for the more time consuming functions.

In order to ensure the accuracy of the numerical approximation, we have compared its results with a spherical shell with linear and exponential density functions, similar to the test performed by \cite{Uieda2016}.
Although in this case, the analytical expressions for both density functions had to be derived.

It also makes use of some previously existing classes and functions from Fatiando a Terra, what saved us time and allowed us to focus on the new enhancements.
Furthermore, we have the intention to include it into a future release of the Fatiando a Terra library in order to make its distribution and maintenance easier.

In the following sections we will describe how the new algorithm works, its theoretical background and obtain the distance-size ratio values needed to get a good accuracy in the computation.

\section{Theory}

The spherical prisms known as tesseroids are mass elements defined in a geocentric spherical coordinate system bounded by a pair of parallels, a pair of  meridians, and two concentric spherical surfaces.
We define an external computation point $P(r, \phi, \lambda)$ where the gravity fields generated by the tesseroid are going to be calculated with respect to the local north oriented Cartesian coordinate system located at $P$.
In the special case of homogeneous density, the gravity potential, gradient and Marussi tensor components can be calculated through the integrals obtained by \citet{Grombein2013} \citep[see also][]{Uieda2016}.

In our case, we will suppose that the tesseroid has an arbitrary variable density in depth, i.e. only depends on the radius spherical coordinate.
Thus, the integrals for the gravity fields are slightly modified:

\begin{equation}
    V(r,\phi,\lambda) = G
    \int\limits_{\lambda_1}^{\lambda_2}
    \int\limits_{\phi_1}^{\phi_2}
    \int\limits_{r_1}^{r_2}
    \frac{\rho(r')}{\ell} \kappa \,  dr' d\phi' d\lambda',
\label{eq:tesseroid-pot}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    g_{\alpha}(r,\phi,\lambda) = G
    \int\limits_{\lambda_1}^{\lambda_2}
    \int\limits_{\phi_1}^{\phi_2}
    \int\limits_{r_1}^{r_2}
    \rho(r') \frac{\Delta_\alpha}{\ell^3}
    \kappa \, dr' d\phi' d\lambda',
\label{eq:tesseroid-grav}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    g_{\alpha\beta}(r,\phi,\lambda) = G
    \int\limits_{\lambda_1}^{\lambda_2}
    \int\limits_{\phi_1}^{\phi_2}
    \int\limits_{r_1}^{r_2}
    \rho(r') I_{\alpha\beta} \, \kappa \, dr' d\phi' d\lambda' ,
    \label{eq:tesseroid-tensor}
\end{equation}

\noindent where

\begin{equation}
    I_{\alpha\beta} =
    \left(
        \frac{3\Delta_{\alpha} \Delta_{\beta}}{\ell^5} -
        \frac{\delta_{\alpha\beta}}{\ell^3}
    \right) ,
    \label{eq:tesseroid-tensor-kernel}
\end{equation}

\noindent $\alpha, \beta \in \{x, y, z\}$,
$\rho(r')$ is the density function that depends on the radius coordinate,
$\delta_{\alpha\beta}$ is Kronecker's delta,
$G = 6.674\times10^{-11}\, \text{m$^3$kg$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$}$ is the gravitational constant and

\begin{equation}
    \Delta_x = r'[\cos\phi\sin\phi' - \sin\phi\cos\phi'
               \cos(\lambda' - \lambda)],
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \Delta_y = r' \cos \phi' \sin(\lambda' - \lambda),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \Delta_z = r' \cos \psi - r,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \kappa = {r'}^2 \cos \phi',
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \ell = \sqrt{{r'}^2 + r^2 - 2 r' r \cos \psi},
\label{eq:ell}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \cos\psi = \sin\phi\sin\phi' + \cos\phi\cos\phi'
                 \cos(\lambda' - \lambda).
\label{eq:cospsi}
\end{equation}


According to \citet[p.~390]{Hildebrand1987}, we can approximate any integral in the interval $[-1, 1]$ using a $N$th order GLQ, i.e. by a weighted sum of the integration kernel evaluated on the roots of the $N$th Legendre polynomial:

\begin{equation}
    \int\limits_{-1}^1 f(x) dx \approx \frac{b-a}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N W_i f(x_i),
\end{equation}

\noindent where $x_i$ are the roots of the $N$th Legendre polynomial $P_N(x)$ and $W_i$ are the weights of each term:

\begin{equation}
    W_i = \frac{2}{(1-x_i^2)[P_N^\prime(x_i)]^2},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    P_N(x_i) = 0, \quad \forall i = {1,\dots,N}.
\end{equation}

In case of an integration defined on a arbitrary interval, e.g. $[a,b]$, we can scale the nodes and perform a similar approximation:

\begin{equation}
    \int\limits_a^b f(x) dx \approx \frac{b-a}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N W_i f(x_i^s),
\label{eq:glq-scaled}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $x_i^s$ is the scaled $x_i$ root in the $[a,b]$ interval, also called nodes of the quadrature:

\begin{equation}
    x_i^s = \frac{b-a}{2} x_i + \frac{b+a}{2}.
\end{equation}

For example, if we use a second order GLQ, the roots of the $P_2(x)$ Legendre polynomial and its corresponding weights are $x_i = \pm 0.577350269$ and $W_i = 1$, respectively.

Our intention is to use GLQ to approximate the volume integrals from equations \ref{eq:tesseroid-pot}-\ref{eq:tesseroid-tensor}. 
When tesseroids have variable densities, we can write the integral kernels as the product of a certain function $g$ and the density function:

\begin{equation}
    f(r', \phi', \lambda') = \rho(r') g(r', \phi', \lambda'),
\end{equation}

\noindent and then apply the quadrature to every integral corresponding to each spherical coordinate, obtaining a similar expression to the one shown by \citet{Asgharzadeh2007} and \citet{Uieda2016}:

\iftwocol{
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \iiint\limits_\Omega \rho(r') g(r', \phi', \lambda') 
        d\Omega \approx& \\
        A 
        \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N^r}
        \sum\limits_{j=1}^{N^\phi}
        \sum\limits_{k=1}^{N^\lambda}
        & W_i^r W_j^\phi W_k^\lambda \rho(r_i) g(r_i, \phi_j, \lambda_k),
    \end{split}
\label{eq:glq-var-dens}
\end{equation}
}{
\begin{equation}
    \iiint\limits_\Omega \rho(r') g(r', \phi', \lambda') d\Omega \approx
    A 
    \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N^r}
    \sum\limits_{j=1}^{N^\phi}
    \sum\limits_{k=1}^{N^\lambda}
    W_i^r W_j^\phi W_k^\lambda \rho(r_i) g(r_i, \phi_j, \lambda_k),
\label{eq:glq-var-dens}
\end{equation}
}

\noindent where

\begin{equation}
    A = 
    \frac{(\lambda_2 - \lambda_1)(\phi_2 - \phi_1)(r_2 - r_1)}{8}.
\end{equation}

From equation \ref{eq:glq-var-dens} we can observe that the GLQ approximates the gravity fields of a tesseroid with variable density as the ones generated by point masses located at the nodes of the Legendre polynomials.
Furthermore, the information of the density function is summarised as the values it assumes on those nodes.
Although this may sound discouraging, we intent to prove otherwise and show that this method, along with a well fitted discretization algorithm, approximates the gravity fields with good accuracy and precision.\todo{no se si poner esta ultima oracion}

\subsection{Analytical Solutions for Spherical Shell}

In order to test the accuracy of the GLQ approximation, \citet{Uieda2016} and \citet{Grombein2013} have compared the computed gravity fields with the ones generated by a spherical shell, the exceptional case with analytical solution \citep{Mikuska2006,Grombein2013}.

In case of variable density tesseroids, the comparison must obviously be made with a variable density spherical shell, whose analytical solution will depend on the chosen density function.
Because the literature has not offered it yet, we needed to develop it ourselves.

Lets consider a spherical shell with inner and outer radii $R_1$ and $R_2$, respectivetly, which density depends on the radius spherical coordinate (Figure \ref{fig:spherical-shell}).
The gravity potential generated by the shell on an arbitrary external point $Q(0,0,r)$, located along the $z$ axe at a distance $r$ from the origin, can be written as follows:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{figures/spherical-shell.pdf}
\caption{
Spherical shell with inner and outer radii $R_1$ and $R_2$, respectively.
The computation point $Q$ is located in the $z$ axe at a distance $r$ from the centre of the shell.
For practical purposes we will assume that $Q$ is outside the outer radii, i.e. $r > R_2$.
}
\label{fig:spherical-shell}
\end{figure}

\begin{equation}
    V_\text{sh}(r) = G 
    \int\limits_0^{2\pi}
    \int\limits_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^\frac{\pi}{2}
    \int\limits_{R_1}^{R_2}
    \frac{\rho(r')}{\ell} {r'}^2 \cos\phi' \, 
    dr' d\phi' d\lambda',
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\ell$ is defined as in equation \ref{eq:ell}.
The computation point $Q$ is located at latitude $\phi=90^\circ$, so $\ell$ and $\cos\psi$ (defined in equation \ref{eq:cospsi}) get simplified:

\begin{equation}
    \cos\psi = \sin\phi', \quad
    \ell = \sqrt{r'^2 + 2 r r' \sin\phi' + r^2}.
\end{equation}

Due to the rotational symmetry along the $z$ axe, the integration in $\lambda'$ is straightforward:

\begin{equation}
    V_\text{sh}(r) = 2\pi G 
    \int\limits_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^\frac{\pi}{2}
    \int\limits_{R_1}^{R_2}
    \frac{\rho(r') {r'}^2 \cos\phi'}{\sqrt{r'^2 + 2 r r' \sin\phi' + r^2}}
    \, dr' d\phi',
\end{equation}

\noindent and the integration in $\phi'$ can be performed independently of the density function.
Using \citet{sagemath} we obtain the following expression:

\iftwocol{
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        V_\text{sh}(r) = 2\pi G
        \int\limits_{R_1}^{R_2}
        \Big[ & \sqrt{r^2 + r'^2 + 2rr'} - \\
        & \sqrt{r^2 + r'^2 - 2rr'}
        \Big] \frac{r'\rho(r')}{r} \, dr'.
    \end{split}
\label{eq:shell-pot-sqrts}
\end{equation}
}{
\begin{equation}
    V_\text{sh}(r) = 2\pi G
    \int\limits_{R_1}^{R_2}
    \Big[ \sqrt{r^2 + r'^2 + 2rr'}  -
    \sqrt{r^2 + r'^2 - 2rr'} 
    \Big] \frac{r'\rho(r')}{r} \, dr'.
\label{eq:shell-pot-sqrts}
\end{equation}
}

For our purposes we can assume that the computation point $Q$ is outside the outer radii, i.e. $r>R_2$ ($R_2 \geq r'$), and simplify the square roots in equation \ref{eq:shell-pot-sqrts}:

\begin{equation}
    \sqrt{r^2 + r'^2 + 2rr'} = |r + r'| = r + r',
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \sqrt{r^2 + r'^2 - 2rr'} = |r - r'| = r - r',
\end{equation}

\noindent what leads to the following expression of the potential of the spherical shell:

\begin{equation}
    V_\text{sh}(r) = \frac{4\pi G}{r}
    \int\limits_{R_1}^{R_2} {r'}^2 \rho(r') \, dr'.
\label{eq:shell-pot}
\end{equation}

The equation \ref{eq:shell-pot} allows to easily obtain the exact gravity field generated by a spherical shell with a variable density in depth on any outside point located in the $z$ axe.
Due to the rotational symmetry along any axe that passes through the centre of the shell, the potential in equation \ref{eq:shell-pot} reassembles the gravity field on any outside point at distance $r$ from the its centre.

For any density $\rho(r')$, the gradient and Marussi tensor components can be obtained as \citet{Grombein2013} does.
Only the vertical gradient component ($g_z$) and the diagonal Marussi tensor components ($g_{xx}$, $g_{yy}$, $g_{zz}$) are non zero, and can be easily determined from the potential $V_\text{sh}$:

\begin{equation}
    g_z = \frac{V_\text{sh}(r)}{r},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    g_{xx} = g_{yy} = -\frac{V_\text{sh}(r)}{r^2}, \quad
    g_{zz} = \frac{2V_\text{sh}(r)}{r^2}.
\end{equation}

For practical purposes we are going to obtain the gravity potential for two very different functions in the perspective of their variation in $r'$: a linear density and an exponential density. \todo{agregar discontinua}


\subsubsection{Linear Density}

If the density of the spherical shell is a linear function on the radius coordinate, i.e.:

\begin{equation}
    \rho(r') = ar' + b,
\end{equation}

\noindent then the gravity potential generated on any computation point at distance $r$ from its centre can be obtained from the following expression:

\begin{equation}
    V_\text{sh}^\text{lin}(r) = \pi G \left[ 
    a \frac{R_2^4 - R_1^4}{r} +
    b \,\frac{4}{3} \frac{R_2^3 - R_1^3}{r} \right].
    \label{eq:shell-pot-linear}
\end{equation}

The second term on equation \ref{eq:shell-pot-linear} reassembles the potential generated by a spherical shell with homogeneous density $\rho = b$ \citep{Mikuska2006,Grombein2013}.
So, this potential can be read as the combination of a spherical shell with the later homogeneous density and the same shell with variable density $\rho(r') = ar'$.


\subsubsection{Exponential Density}

If, on the other hand, the spherical shell has an exponential density in the radius coordinate,

\begin{equation}
    \rho(r') = Ae^{-(r' - \Delta h)/b},
\end{equation}

\noindent the potential can be written as follows:

\iftwocol{
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        V_\text{sh}^\text{exp}(r) = \frac{4\pi G}{r} 
        Ab \, e^\frac{\Delta h}{b}
        \Big[
        & (R_1^2 + 2R_1 b + 2b^2)e^{-\frac{R_1}{b}} - \\
        & (R_2^2 + 2R_2 b + 2b^2)e^{-\frac{R_2}{b}}
        \Big].
    \end{split}
\label{eq:shell-pot-exp}
\end{equation}
}{
\begin{equation}
    V_\text{sh}^\text{exp}(r) = \frac{4\pi G}{r} 
    Ab \, e^\frac{\Delta h}{b}
    \Big[
    & (R_1^2 + 2R_1 b + 2b^2)e^{-\frac{R_1}{b}} - \\
    & (R_2^2 + 2R_2 b + 2b^2)e^{-\frac{R_2}{b}}
    \Big].
\label{eq:shell-pot-exp}
\end{equation}
}

\section{Implementation}

We have developed a Python library that computes the gravity fields generated by any Tesseroid with variable density in depth through the GLQ to numerically approximate the volume integrals.
It's freely available under the BSD 3-clause open-source library and can be downloaded from the following repository: \todo{agregar repo, vale la pena poner el link?}

Although it's a Python library, the core functions of the computation are written in Cython, a superset of Python language that allows us to generate efficient C code through the Cython compiler.
This produces a precompiled library whose functions and classes can be called from regular Python code, what allowed us to make it compatible with the preexisting open-source library Fatiando a Terra \citep{Uieda2013}.

Its usage is very similar to the code for homogeneous tesseroid already in Fatiando a Terra (version 0.5):

\begin{enumerate}
\renewcommand{\theenumi}{(\arabic{enumi})}
    \item Define a single tesseroid (or a tesseroid mesh) with the Fatiando a Terra classes.
    \item Add a predefined Python density function to the tesseroid (or each tesseroid in the mesh).
    \item Calculate the desired gravity field (potential, gradient or tensor component) in any set of computation points with our new functions.
\end{enumerate}

The existing code in Fatiando a Terra (v.~0.5) for homogeneous tesseroid is optimised through the Numba compiler.
Due to difficulties when passing a Python function as argument of precompiled Numba methods, we have decided to rewrite them in Cython language, keeping the homogeneous tesseroid calculation and adding the new variable density code.

\todo{speed comparison between homogeneous and variable density}

From equation \ref{eq:glq-var-dens} we saw that the GLQ approximates the volume integrals as the gravitational effect of $N_\lambda N_\phi N_r$ point masses, where $N_i$ are the orders of the quadrature for the integral on each coordinate, with $i \in \{ \lambda, \phi, r \}$.

If we set the GLQ orders to fixed values, it's easy to conclude that the nearer the computation point is to the tesseroid, the accuracy of the approximation is reduced and the point masses effect becomes more noticeable than the tesseroid we want to approximate.
A more complete analysis of this conclusion can be found in \citet{Ku1977, Li2011, Uieda2016}.

Instead of increasing the GLQ orders to improve the accuracy, what leads to a more time consuming computation, adaptive discretization algorithms have been applied in previous works \citep{Li2011, Uieda2016}.
They basically consist in dividing the tesseroid based on a ratio between its size and the distance between its geometric centre and the computation point.

In order to make the computation more efficient, we use only second order GLQ for each integration, and we ensure the accuracy of the method through the application of the modified adaptive discretization algorithm developed by \citet{Uieda2016}.
Given an arbitrary tesseroid, \citet{Uieda2016} redefined its dimensions: $L_\lambda$, $L_\phi$ and $L_r$, where the former ones are the arc-distances measured along its top surface and $L_r$ is the difference between the radii of the top and bottom surfaces.
We must check that the following inequality is satisfied:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{d}{L_i} \geq D,
\label{eq:distance-size-ratio}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $i \in \{\lambda, \phi, r\}$, $d$ is the distance between the geometric centre of the tesseroid and the computation point and $D$ is a predefined value called distance-size ratio.
If the inequality \ref{eq:distance-size-ratio} is not held for any spherical coordinate, then the tesseroid must be divided by half in that direction.
A more complete description of the modified adaptive discretization algorithm can be found in \citet{Uieda2016}.

In summary, the distance-size ratio $D$ determines indirectly how many times the tesseroids will be divided and therefore both the accuracy of the algorithm and its computation time.
In this way, the modified version of the adaptive discretization algorithm efficiently improves its accuracy and gives the user more control over the computation: it allows to stop the division of the tesseroids when their dimensions are lower than a certain value (e.g. less than 10 cm), which does not modifies significantly the desired gravitational field.

On the other hand, the accuracy of the method is exclusively controlled by the value assigned to the distance-size ratio $D$, which cannot be easily related to the error of the approximation.
In order to solve this, \citet{Uieda2016} compared the numerical computation with the analytical solution for a spherical shell with homogeneous density.

We have performed similar tests, but now with variable density spherical shell.
From the infinite density functions that can be proposed, we have chosen two characteristic ones: a linear and an exponential functions. \todo{agregar discontinua}
The first one constitutes the simplest variation, while the second one represents the fastest varying function.
The analytical solutions for these two types of functions were previously obtained and shown in equations \ref{eq:shell-pot-linear} and \ref{eq:shell-pot-exp}.

\section{Determination of distance-size ratio}

In order to test the new variable density tesseroid code and to estimate the error of the approximation we have compared the numerical model with the analytical solutions for a spherical shell with variable density for two special cases: a linear and an exponential density function. \todo{agregar discontinua}
This error estimations are also useful in the determination of the minimum value for the distance-size ratio $D$ such the difference between the numerical model and the analytical solutions are below an acceptable threshold.

We approximated the spherical shell by a mesh of $30^\circ \times 30^\circ$ tesseroids and calculated the gravity potential, the vertical component of the gradient ($g_z$) and the $g_{zz}$ component of the Marussi tensor on four different grids: (1) a grid located at the pole, (2) another one on the Equator, (3) one located at satellite height and (4) a big grid of $30^\circ \times 30^\circ$.
More information about this grids can be found in the Table \ref{tab:grids}.

We computed the three gravity fields for different values of $D$, ranging from 0.5 to 10 with a step of 0.5, on every point of these four grids.
Then, we calculated the maximum difference between these results and the value of the analytical solution at the same height.

Because the gravity fields generated by a tesseroid are approximated by the effect of point masses, the numerical results may vary between computation points at same height but at different latitude or longitude.
That's why we choose for comparison the maximum difference between the results on every point of the grid and the analytical solution.

Finally, we set the acceptable value of $D$ at which the error of the numerical approximation is lower than 10$^{-1}\%$.

The tests were only performed on these three magnitudes because the other components of the gravity gradient and Marussi tensor are equal to zero due to the rotational symmetries of the spherical shell.

\subsection{Linear Density}

As a simple case, we proposed a linear density function in such a way that the spherical shell has a density of 2670~kg/m$^3$ on the surface of the Earth, and 3300~kg/m$^3$ at 35 km of depth:

\begin{equation}
    \rho(r') = 
    -\frac{3300 - 2670}{35000} r' + 
    \left( \frac{3300 - 2670}{35000} R + 2670 \right)
    \label{eq:density-linear}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $R$ = 6378.137 km is the mean Earth radius.

The tests were performed on a thin and a thick spherical shell of 1 km and 35 km of thickness, respectively.
The results for both cases can be seen in Figures \ref{fig:D-linear-thin} and \ref{fig:D-linear-thick}.

For the linear density case, we can observe that the calculation of the potential and the $g_z$ component of its gradient needs a value of $D=1$ and $D=2$, respectively, in order to ensure an accuracy of 10$^{-1}\%$.
On the other hand, the $g_{zz}$ computations show a noticeable difference between the thin and the thick shell: the first one needs a value of $D=8$ while the later only a $D=3.5$.
We will keep the more conservative result of $D=8$ in case of computing the $g_{zz}$ tensor component in case of a linear density tesseroid.

}
\label{fig:D-linear-thick}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Exponential Density}

To test the model in case of an exponential density we proposed the following function:

\begin{equation}
    \rho(r') = A e^{-(r' - R)/b}
\label{eq:density-exp}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $A$ = 1 kg/m$^3$ and $b$ = 10$^6$ m.
We have also performed this test with a thin and a thick shell of 1 km and 35 km, respectively, and the results can be seen in Figures \ref{fig:D-exp-thin} and \ref{fig:D-exp-thick}.

In the same way we analysed the linear density results, we can summarise that the thin spherical shell presents the more conservative values of the distance-size ratio: $D=1$ for the gravity potential, $D=2$ for its gradient components and $D=8$ for the Marussi tensor components.

Surprisingly both the linear and the exponential density tesseroid models needs the same values of distance-size ratio $D$ in order to assure a good accuracy.
Because the two functions are significantly different we can expect that these values of $D$ are good for a wide variety of density functions.\todo{no se si da para poner esto}

If the difference is less than 10$^{-1}\%$, we consider that the model has achieved an acceptable accuracy for the corresponding value of $D$.

}
\label{fig:D-exp-thick}
\end{figure}

Because the constant $b$ controls the variation of the density function we wanted to test how does the accuracy of the method behaves at different values of $b$.
We computed the difference between the Marussi tensor component $g_{zz}$ generated by the numerical model and the analytical solution on the big grid of 30$^\circ\times$30$^\circ$ (see Table \ref{tab:grids}).
For each value of $b$ we computed these difference for the same set of values of $D$ we've been using on the previous tests, obtaining one curve for each kind of variation.

The results can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:D-exp-power}.
Lower values of $b$ implies a more varying function.
We can see that for extremely varying functions the numerical model does not perform well: for a $b$=100m the difference is almost 100\%.

\subsection{Discontinuous Density}

As a final case, we propose to perform the same test with a discontinuous density function:

\begin{equation}
    \rho(r') = 
    \begin{cases}
        \rho_1 & \text{if} \, R_1 \leq r' < R_c \\
        \rho_2 & \text{if} \, R_c \leq r' \leq R_2 \\
    \end{cases}
\label{eq:density-discontinuous}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$ are constant densities, $R_1$ and $R_2$ are the inner and outer radii of the shell, respectively, and $R_c$ is the the radii on which the 
density changes.

\todo{poner solucion analitica}

First we assume a symmetric density function, i.e. $R_c=(R_1 + R_2)/2$ is the centre radius of the shell, and perform the test for a thin shell of 1km of thickness.
The results can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:D-discont-sym}.
Again, we obtain good accuracy for values of $D=$1,2 and 8 for the computation of the potential, the gradient components and the Marussi tensor components, respectively.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/Ddiscontinuous-symmetric-differences.pdf}
\caption{
    Differences between the gravity fields generated by the numerical model and the analytical solution for a thin spherical shell of 1km of thickness and the discontinuous density defined on equation \ref{eq:density-discontinuous}, with $R_c$ as the centre radius of the shell. The computations were performed on the four grids described in Table \ref{tab:grids} and for different values of the distance-size ratio $D$. If the difference is less than 10$^{-1}\%$, we consider that the model has achieved an acceptable accuracy for the corresponding value of $D$.
}
\label{fig:D-discont-sym}
\end{figure}

Secondly, lets assume the same density function from equation \ref{eq:density-discontinuous}, but now with an asymmetrical distribution such as $R_c = (R_1 + R_2)/3$, and perform the same test.
We can see its results in Figure \ref{fig:D-discont-asym}: up to $D=10$ the difference between the numerical model and the analytical solution is greater than 10\%, what
lead us to conclude that the code does not reassembles the gravity fields for this case with good accuracy.

The computations were performed on the four grids described in Table \ref{tab:grids} and for different values of the distance-size ratio $D$. If the difference is less than 10$^{-1}\%$, we consider that the model has achieved an acceptable accuracy for the corresponding value of $D$.
}
\label{fig:D-discont-asym}
\end{figure}

From equation \ref{eq:glq-var-dens} we have seen that the information of the density function is summarised as the values its assumes on the nodes of the GLQ.
We can attribute the low performance of the code to this simplification.

On the other hand, we can explain the good performance in the symmetrical density case due to the fact that the GLQ nodes are always symmetrical with respect to the centre of the $[a,b]$ integration interval (see equation \ref{eq:glq-scaled}).

In the light of these results we do not recommend using discontinuous densities functions. Instead, divide the tesseroid into several ones with specific homogeneous density or densityfunction for each one.
